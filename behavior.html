            <h2>How Tigers Behave</h2>
            <p>Tigers are usually quiet, careful animals. Most adult tigers live alone and travel around their own “home area”.</p>

            <div class="grid" style="margin-top: 12px;">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="images/behavior.jpg" alt="Tiger walking in the forest">

                <div>
                    <h3>At a glance</h3>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li><strong>Solo life:</strong> most adults live alone</li>
                        <li><strong>Home area:</strong> a tiger uses the same region again and again</li>
                        <li><strong>Messages:</strong> scent marks, scratches, sounds, body language</li>
                        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> tigers usually avoid people</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

        <section class="card">
            <h3>Home area and movement</h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>A tiger’s home area can be very large, because it needs enough space to find food.</li>
                <li>Male tigers often travel over bigger areas than females.</li>
                <li>Sometimes a male’s area overlaps with areas used by several females.</li>
                <li>Young tigers leave their mother when they are older and try to find their own home area.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How tigers communicate</h3>
            <p>Tigers do not “talk” like people, but they still send lots of messages.</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><strong>Scent:</strong> they can leave smell marks (like a “note”) so other tigers know they were there.</li>
                <li><strong>Scratches:</strong> they scratch trees to leave signs and smells.</li>
                <li><strong>Body language:</strong> tail, ears, and posture can show feelings.</li>
                <li><strong>Sounds:</strong> they can growl and roar. A roar can travel far to let others know “I’m here”.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tigers and people</h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Most of the time, tigers try to stay away from people.</li>
                <li>Problems can happen when people and tigers live close together.</li>
                <li>If wild prey is hard to find, a tiger may go closer to farms and livestock, which can cause conflict.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Did you know?</h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Tigers can swim well and may cross rivers to travel.</li>
                <li>A tiger’s stripe pattern helps it blend into grass and shadows.</li>
                <li>Tigers use smells and scratches like “signposts” in the forest.</li>
            </ul>
